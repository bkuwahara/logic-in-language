Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that under the rules of epistemic logic, knowledge is assumed to be true while belief may or may not be true. Think step by step.

Premise: James remembers that Michael believes that a man is walking past a large sign that says E.S.E. Electronics. Hypothesis: Michael believes that a man is walking past a large sign that says E.S.E. Electronics.
Reasoning: Let p be the proposition that a man is walking past a large sign that says E.S.E. Electronics. The premise is that James knows that Michael believes p. The hypothesis is p. Since James knows p, p must be true. Therefore the premise entails the hypothesis.
Answer: entailment
