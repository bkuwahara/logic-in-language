Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that under the rules of epistemic logic, knowledge is assumed to be true while belief may or may not be true. Think step by step.

Premise: Evelyn suspects that Joseph understands that a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics. Hypothesis: Joseph understands that a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that at a table with an art camp pamphlet on it, a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics under the supervision of a blond woman wearing a name tag. The premise is that Evelyn believes that Joseph knows p. The hypothesis is that Joseph knows p. Evelyn's belief may be incorrect. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.
Answer: non-entailment

Premise: Robert assumes that Olivia assumes that artists install a new exhibit. Hypothesis: Hypothesis: Olivia believes that it is not the case that a man straps surfboards on top of his car.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that artists install a new exhibit and q be the event that a man straps surfboards on top of his car. The premise is that Robert believes that Olivia believes p. The hypothesis is that Olivia believes not q. The hypothesis and premise are unrelated, so the premise does not entail the hypothesis.
Answer: non-entailment

Premise: Richard suspects that Amelia knows that the wind propels a sailing ship. Hypothesis: Richard suspects that the wind propels a sailing ship.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that the wind propels a sailing ship. The premise is that Richard believes that Amelia knows p. The hypothesis is that Richard believes p. Since Richard believes Amelia knows p, he believes p is true. Thus, the premise entails the hypothesis.
Answer: entailment
