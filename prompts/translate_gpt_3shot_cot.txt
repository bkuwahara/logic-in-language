The following examples may be used if you wish to translate the given premise and hypothesis into epistemic logic notation. Use $$B(Agent,p)$$ to denote that Agent believes p and $$K(Agent,p)$$ to denote that Agent knows p. Use p ^ q to denote p and q.

Premise: Evelyn suspects that Joseph understands that a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics. Hypothesis: Ava understands that Emma suspects that a person with braided hair covers his mouth. 
Reasoning: Reasoning: Let p be the event that a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics and q be the event that a person with braided hair covers his mouth. The premise is that Evelyn believes that Joseph knows p. The hypothesis is that Ava knows that Emma believes q.
Translated premise: $$B(Evelyn,K(Joseph,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$K(Ava,B(Emma,q))$$

Premise: Robert assumes that Olivia assumes that artists install a new exhibit in a gallery. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that it is not the case that a topless man straps surfboards on top of his car.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that artists install a new exhibit in a gallery and q be the event that a topless man straps surfboards on top of his car. The premise is that Robert believes that Olivia believes p. The hypothesis is that Olivia believes !q. 
Translated premise: $$B(Robert,B(Olivia,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Olivia,!q)$$

Premise: Richard suspects that a man wearing shorts and a blue t-shirt is applying signage to the display window of an ice cream shop. Hypothesis: Richard suspects that a man is putting a sign in the window.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that a man is wearing shorts and a blue t-shirt and q be the event that a man is applying signage to the window. The premise is that Richard believes p and q. The hypothesis is that Richard believes q.
Translated premise: $$B(Richard,p ^ q)$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Richard,q)$$
