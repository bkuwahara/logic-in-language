Translate each of the following premises and hypotheses into Epistemic logic notation. Use $$B(Agent,p)$$ to denote that Agent believes p and $$K(Agent,p)$$ to denote that Agent knows p. Use p ^ q to denote p and q. Think step by step.

Premise: James remembers that Michael believes that a man is walking past a large sign that says E.S.E. Electronics. Hypothesis: Michael believes that a man is walking past a large sign that says E.S.E. Electronics.
Reasoning: Let p be the proposition that a man is walking past a large sign that says E.S.E. Electronics. The premise is that James knows that Michael believes p. The hypothesis is that Michael believes p.
Translated premise: $$K(James,B(Michael,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Michael,p))$$

Premise: Charlotte recognizes that David believes that two adults hold either side of a boat at the edge of the water. Hypothesis: David believes that Charlotte recognizes that two adults hold either side of a boat at the edge of the water.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that two adults hold either side of a boat at the edge of the water. The premise says that Charlotte knows David believes p. The hypothesis is that David believes that Charlotte knows p.
Translated premise: $$K(Charlotte,B(David,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(David,K(Charlotte,p))$$

Premise: Evelyn suspects that Joseph understands that at a table with an art camp pamphlet on it, a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics under the supervision of a blond woman wearing a name tag. Hypothesis: Ava understands that Emma suspects that a person with braided hair and a gray sweatshirt covers his mouth and sits in a purple chair.

The premise is that Evelyn believes that Joseph knows p. The hypothesis is that Ava knows that Emma believes q.
Translated premise: $$B(Evelyn,K(Joseph,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$K(Ava,B(Emma,q))$$

Premise: Robert assumes that Olivia assumes that artists install a new exhibit in a gallery. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that a topless man straps surfboards on top of his blue car.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that artists install a new exhibit in a gallery and q be the event that a topless man straps surfboards on top of his blue car. The premise is that Robert believes that Olivia believes p. The hypothesis is that Olivia believes q. 
Translated premise: $$B(Robert,B(Olivia,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Olivia,q)$$

Premise: Richard suspects that a man wearing shorts and a blue t-shirt is applying signage to the display window of an ice cream shop. Hypothesis: Richard suspects that a man is putting a sign in the window.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that a man is wearing shorts and a blue t-shirt and q be the event that a man is applying signage to the window. The premise is that Richard believes p and q. The hypothesis is that Richard believes q.
Translated premise: $$B(Richard,p ^ q)$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Richard,q)$$
