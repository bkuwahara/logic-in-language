Translate each of the following premises and hypotheses into Epistemic logic notation. Use $$B(A,p)$$ to denote that A believes p, $$K(A,p)$$ to denote that A knows p, p ^ q to denote p and q, and !p to denote not p. Think step by step.

Premise: Evelyn suspects that Joseph understands that at a table with an art camp pamphlet on it, a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics under the supervision of a blond woman wearing a name tag. Hypothesis: Ava understands that Emma suspects that a person with braided hair and a gray sweatshirt covers his mouth and sits in a purple chair. 
Reasoning: Reasoning: Let p be the event that at a table with an art camp pamphlet on it, a young woman and an older man are painting ceramics under the supervision of a blond woman wearing a name tag and q be the event that a person with braided hair and a gray sweatshirt covers his mouth and sits in a purple chair. The premise is that Evelyn believes that Joseph knows p. The hypothesis is that Ava knows that Emma believes q.
Translated premise: $$B(Evelyn,K(Joseph,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$K(Ava,B(Emma,q))$$

Premise: Robert assumes that Olivia assumes that artists install a new exhibit in a gallery. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that it is not the case that a topless man straps surfboards on top of his blue car.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that artists install a new exhibit in a gallery and q be the event that a topless man straps surfboards on top of his blue car. The premise is that Robert believes that Olivia believes p. The hypothesis is that Olivia believes !q. 
Translated premise: $$B(Robert,B(Olivia,p))$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Olivia,!q)$$

Premise: Richard suspects that a man wearing shorts and a blue t-shirt is applying signage to the display window of an ice cream shop. Hypothesis: Richard suspects that a man is putting a sign in the window.
Reasoning: Let p be the event that a man is wearing shorts and a blue t-shirt and q be the event that a man is applying signage to the window. The premise is that Richard believes p and q. The hypothesis is that Richard believes q.
Translated premise: $$B(Richard,p ^ q)$$
Translated hypothesis: $$B(Richard,q)$$
